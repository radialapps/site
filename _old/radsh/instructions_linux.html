<b>How to run the demo?</b>
<ul id="instructions">
    <li>Download the demo <a href="{{demo_link}}">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Place the downloaded file in your home directory. To make sure that the game supports all systems, we have created an install-free package.</li>
    <li>Right click the file and select "Extract Here".</li>
    <li>If you don't see such an option, you may alternatively go to the terminal and run:</li>
    <blockquote>
        <span>
            gunzip {{demo_file_1}}<br>
            tar -xvf {{demo_file_2}}
        </span>
    </blockquote>
    <li>This will extract the contents of the package.</li>
    <li>Go to the directory and run the file "aveyond" by double clicking on it and choosing Run.</li>
    <li>If you cannot run the file, right click it and click properties. Check Allow executing file. Repeat this step for the files "engine-x86" and "engine-amd64"</li>
    Alternatively, you may go to the directory in terminal and run the following command:
    <blockquote>
        <span>
            chmod 777 aveyond engine*
        </span>
    </blockquote>
    and then use
    <blockquote>
        <span>
            ./aveyond
        </span>
    </blockquote>
    to run the game.
    <br>
    Enjoy the game!
