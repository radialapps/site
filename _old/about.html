            <h2> Who are we? </h2>
            <p> The idea of RadialApps was conceived in one of the smaller cities of India in 2011, as a multi-purpose firm with focus on software and security.
            At that time, it started with a budget of zero cents, and clibmed up to come where it is today. We believed that a lot of hard
            work can lead to success without having unlimited resources. It proved to be true.</p>
            
            <h2> What do we do?</h2>
            <p> Our goal is clear: make something useful and, if possible, something new. We understand that it might not always be easy to achieve this goal,
            but we still keep trying!</p>
            <p> We have ported the entire Aveyond series and the indie game Exit Fate to Linux and Mac. Some of our other exploits include porting Exit Fate and Last Scenario
            to Android. </p>
